# intensive.dance

A worldwide register of **intensive courses and master classes** for **classical** and **contemporary ballet**, scraped from the schools and companies that run them.

> Working name. First milestone: scrape intensives into our DB. Nothing user-facing yet.

## What we collect

For every intensive / master class we care about:

- **Time range** — when it runs (start/end, plus the year's "season")
- **Organization** — the school or company hosting it
- **Teachers** — who teaches, and *where they actually teach and dance* (their affiliations)
- **Prices** — tuition and what's included, in the local currency
- **Application deadlines**
- **Application requirements** — none · photos in defined poses · video (specific or open brief) · CV · headshots/portraits

## Provider register

We maintain a register of providers to scrape, weighted toward the marquee names in the genre — e.g. The Royal Ballet School, John Cranko School, ABT (JKO School), Joffrey Ballet School, l'École de Danse de l'Opéra de Paris, English National Ballet School, Bolshoi Ballet Academy.

See [`providers.json`](./providers.json) for the seed list and [`docs/data-model.md`](./docs/data-model.md) for the record shape.

## Stack

Python, mirroring museumsufer's ethos (pure-function scrapers, a deterministic data file committed to git, a cron → single-commit workflow) but stripped to a single page.

- **`uv`** — deps + venv
- **`httpx`** — fetching, with an optional pass-through proxy (`FETCH_PROXY_URL` / `FETCH_PROXY_TOKEN`)
- **`selectolax`** — HTML parsing
- **`pydantic`** v2 — the [data model](./docs/data-model.md) as validated models; the `application.requirements` discriminated union is enforced at parse time

```
src/intensive_dance/
  models.py                 # Pydantic models == docs/data-model.md (source of truth)
  fetch.py                  # httpx client (UA + optional proxy)
  scrapers/                 # one pure fn per provider: scrape(client) -> list[Offering]
  run.py                    # scrape -> hash -> write data/<slug>.json
  validate.py               # offline check: committed data parses + hashes match
  schema.py                 # derive/verify schema/offering.schema.json from the models
data/<slug>.json            # the store: committed JSON, one file per provider
schema/offering.schema.json # published JSON Schema for one Offering (CI guards drift)
tests/                      # pytest: pins the regex-heavy parsing, no network
```

Validation is enforced at model construction (Pydantic) when a scraper builds an `Offering`; `validate.py` re-checks the committed store offline in CI.

### Scraping approach — API first

For each provider, try structured sources **before** parsing HTML. Order of preference:

1. **Official / site-powering JSON API** — e.g. a WordPress REST API (`/wp-json/wp/v2/`), a store API, or any documented endpoint
2. **Structured data embedded in the page** — `<script type="application/ld+json">` (schema.org `Event`/`Course`), or an embedded state blob (`__NEXT_DATA__`, etc.)
3. **Machine-readable feeds** — iCal (`.ics`), RSS/Atom
4. **HTML parsing** (`selectolax`) — last resort

Record which source a scraper uses in a comment, so the next person knows whether to look for an API before touching markup.

Run it:

```bash
uv run python -m intensive_dance.run                    # all providers
uv run python -m intensive_dance.run royal-ballet-school # one provider
```

Store is committed JSON (`data/`) for now — every scrape is a reviewable git diff. Pydantic serializes unchanged if we later swap in SQLite/Postgres.

## Status

Eight providers live:

- **The Royal Ballet School** ([#1](https://github.com/boredland/intensive-dance/issues/1)) — WordPress REST + WPBakery; exercises the `photos` requirement.
- **Joffrey Ballet School** — WordPress custom post types (`summer-intensives`, `workshops`) + taxonomy resolution; exercises the `video` requirement. Fees/teachers aren't published in its API, so those stay empty (documented in the scraper).
- **Russian Masters Ballet** — the first **pure-HTML** scrape (a Bitrix site, no API/feed/JSON-LD). Discovers its summer (Alicante, Burgas, St. Petersburg) and winter (Madrid, Perth, Shanghai) locations from the two course indexes and emits one offering per program track. First to exercise **teachers with affiliations** (a named per-track roster linked to Vaganova / Bolshoi / Mariinsky / …) and the `video`/`specific` + `cv` requirement branches.
- **MOSA Ballet School** (Liège, BE) — first European provider; a Squarespace site scraped **sitemap-first** (the sitemap indexes every event; we keep only real intensives/masterclasses and drop past cycles). Exercises EUR course-fee parsing.
- **John Cranko School** (Stuttgart, DE) — its Summer School, from one tidy German page; exercises a EUR fee (incl. performance), an application `deadline`, and a `video`/`specific` audition brief.
- **Frankfurt Ballet Masterclasses** (Frankfurt, DE) — single-page masterclass listing; fetched over a `verify=False` client because the host serves an incomplete TLS certificate chain.
- **Dutch National Ballet Academy** (Amsterdam, NL) — its Amsterdam International Summer School (Senior + Junior courses), from the AHK TYPO3 site; one offering per course with its own age band and fee.
- **École de Danse de l'Opéra national de Paris** (Paris, FR) — its Summer School ("Stage d'été"), read off the large operadeparis.fr site; exercises a non-refundable application-fee note (graduated course fees left out rather than guessed).
